Wanted to keep it simple and back to basics again, using only Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS but this time use webpack to introduce a modular approach.

## My Focus For the Task:

1) To use semantic HTML -  now added alt attributes to images.

2) To implement a slight modular using webpack JS bundler - generating a separate CSS file for performance issues.

3) Apply B.E.M. naming convention [B.E.M naming](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)

4) To produce webpage so it resembles the design as closely as possible.
